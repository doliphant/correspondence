Ruby: 2.2.0
Rails: 4.2.0

This is my capstone project from my time with Bloc.io. This is an ongoing project for trying new things both as developer and a creator of something new. I have always been interested in how we communicate with one another due to both the amazing ways we can share ideas and all of the interesting ways we seem to muck it up. This project sprung from the desire to capture the romantic notion of the classic correspondence. What happens when the permanence of a post is explicit and cannot be edited? Or if two people can carry on a conversation without the influence of a constant barrage of comments, and share it when they choose?

Key Functionality:
  1. A correspondence is created with two users. Once created, both have equal access to the administrative controls of the correspondence. The correspondence can be made public or private at their discretion.
  2. As the users write posts, they only have a 15 minute window to edit it. Explicitly limiting control of the posts is by design to encourage greater thoughtfulness in writing.
  3. Public correspondences can be commented upon by other users. By design, correspondence participants can write their entire correspondence publicly, or keep it private until they feel they have expressed their ideas freely and without the distraction of commentary.

Planned Functionality:
  1. Length requirements. Because saying something in less than 140 characters only requires a couple of thumbs. When forced to write more, we tend to be more thoughtful about it.  
  2. Delayed ability to post repeatedly and respond to posts. The idea here is to create a cooling off period of sorts. By limiting a person's ability to repeatedly post in succession it further encourages thoughtfulness in writing. Delaying the ability to respond does the same by letting a person mull an idea over before being able to respond.
